# KhetiBuddy

KhetiBuddy stands as a testament to the collective efforts of our team at the Global Institute of Technology. Our app is poised to redefine the landscape of farming practices. The name "KhetiBuddy" is derived from the Hindi word "Kheti," meaning farming, and "Buddy," symbolizing a trusted companion. Together, these elements encapsulate our app's essence - a friendly ally in the farming journey, offering support, guidance, and solutions. Also, KhetiBuddy sounds like Khetibaadi (खेतीबाड़ी).
